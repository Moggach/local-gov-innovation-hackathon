**Problem Statement**

We aim to prevent homelessness by developing a tool that helps local
authorities identify the factors that increase a household’s likelihood
of becoming homeless or being at risk.

By securely combining and analysing multiple data sources to detect
early trajectories toward homelessness, the tool will enable timely,
targeted support before households reach crisis point.

This approach seeks to reduce the impact of homelessness on individuals
and families while helping local authorities manage system-wide demand
and alleviate the financial pressures associated with temporary
accommodation.
